## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the nature of the Data Analyst job market in London, UK. Leveraging daily scraped data from Google Jobs search engine via a function created on Google Cloud and SerpAPI, the project seeks to provide insights into the job market by examining various parameters such as salaries, required skills, and years of experience mentioned in job postings.
