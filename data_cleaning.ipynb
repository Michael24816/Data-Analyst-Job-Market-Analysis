      "About Pearson\n",
      "\n",
      "Pearson is the world's leading learning company, with 35,000 employees in more than 70 countries working to help people of all ages to make measurable progress in their lives through learning. We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview of the independent end-point assessor role\n",
      "\n",
      "Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide... employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices, following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with.\n",
      "\n",
      "An independent EPA means that those deciding on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element and must not have been involved in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers and/or providers if appropriate. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "IEAs for these EPAs will be qualified IQAs that meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Accountabilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "The independent end-point assessor will:\n",
      "\n",
      "Take part in regular training and standardisation activities, associated with the role of independent end-point assessor for this EPA\n",
      "\n",
      "Maintain and provide evidence of ongoing, relevant Continuous Professional Development (CPD)\n",
      "\n",
      "Assess the performance of candidates in accordance with published assessment and grading criteria and procedures, ensuring overall standards are maintained\n",
      "\n",

      "Person Specification\n",
      "\n",
      "This occupation is found in any employer in any sector that uses data to make business decisions. Data analysts may work in various departments within a single employer, (for example finance, sales, HR, manufacturing, or marketing), and in any employment sector, public or private, including retail, distribution, defence, banking, logistics, media, local government etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The broad purpose of the occupation is to ascertain how data can be used in order to answer questions and solve problems. Data analysis is a process of requirement-gathering, inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names. In today's world, data analysis plays a crucial role in making decisions more evidence-based and helping organisations operate more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example: a data analyst may investigate social media trends and their impact on the organisation. In retail, a data analyst may break down sales figures to make recommendations on product placement and development. In HR a data analyst may investigate staff retention rates, in order to decide on recruitment strategy. In a hospital, a data analyst may investigate wait times for different departments, in order to provide a better service to its patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with internal or external clients. Internally, the data analyst may work with many people within their organisation, at different levels. Externally a data analyst may provide data analysis services to other organisations on behalf of their employer. Data analysts would normally be office based and work normal business hours.\n",

      "• *Overview of the independent end-point assessor role**\n",
      "\n",
      "Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the... confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices, following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with.\n",
      "\n",
      "An independent EPA means that those deciding on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element and must not have been involved in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers and/or providers if appropriate. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "IEAs for these EPAs will be qualified IQAs that meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pearson is the world's leading learning company, with 35,000 employees in more than 70 countries working to help people of all ages to make measurable progress in their lives through learning. We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview of the independent end-point assessor role\n",
      "\n",
      "Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide... employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices, following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with.\n",
      "\n",
      "An independent EPA means that those deciding on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element and must not have been involved in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers and/or providers if appropriate. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "IEAs for these EPAs will be qualified IQAs that meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Accountabilities:\n",

      "\n",
      "The broad purpose of the occupation is to ascertain how data can be used in order to answer questions and solve problems. Data analysis is a process of requirement-gathering, inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names. In today's world, data analysis plays a crucial role in making decisions more evidence-based and helping organisations operate more effectively.\n",

In a hospital, a data analyst may investigate wait times for different departments, in order to provide a better service to its patients.\n",

We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at\n",
      "• *Overview of the independent end-point assessor role**\n",
      "\n",
      "Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the... confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices, following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with.\n",
      "\n",
      "An independent EPA means that those deciding on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element and must not have been involved in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers and/or providers if appropriate. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "IEAs for these EPAs will be qualified IQAs that meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details.\n",
